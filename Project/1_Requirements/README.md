## Introduction
The main focus of this project is to make a working simulation cum prototype of a
Battery Management System. A BMS has many interpretations some of them comprising
of an embedded balancing module and some with just monitoring modules. Due to the
limitations of the platform(i.e simulIDE) this implementation of the BMS will be
constrained to a **"Battery Monitoring System"**. 

## The BMS implementation has the following Requirements:
