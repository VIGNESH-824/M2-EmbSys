# Project Abstract
***Batteries are the most important propellant today. With increasing power density, the
volatility of the batteries increase. There have been many cases of spontaneous outbreak of fire
through such batteries for example, The most widespread example of this is the Lithium ion
batteries, which is applied in applications from inverters at home to powerful power sources for
vehicles each one of which requires very high levels of safety. Lithium ion batteries need intricate
monitoring of the incoming and outgoing charge. When the each lithium ion cell is connected in a
series or parallel configuration the resultant battery pack as a whole should charge and discharge
equally thereby preserving its state of health and protecting from over-discharge or charge. Battery
Management system (to be referred as BMS) serves the following purpose.***

- Prevent cells from over-current.
- Prevent cells from under-voltage.
- Prevent cells from high temperature thermal runaway.
- Balance each and every cell in the battery pack for the same amount of charge.
- Data logging of current and voltage data.
